	<p id=para1> Once upon a time, there was a cute little koala, always tired and  sleepy, laying on a branch of a big old tree. The little koala would sleep on the branch the whole day and the only times that she would move were the times she needed to eat. 
Days past and the little qoala was getting lazier and lazier each day. Until! one day, while she was leaning on her favorite branch and was enjoying the the warmth of sun rays on  her skin, an extrimly loud bang shattered her peaceful world. </p>
